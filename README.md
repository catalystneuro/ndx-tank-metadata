# ndx-tank-metadata
NWB LabMetaData extension for [Tank lab](https://pni.princeton.edu/faculty/david-tank).

# Install
```
$ pip install ndx-tank-metadata
```

# Usage
This extension is built for extending the LabMetaData schema with custom fields
requested for the conversion of Virmen metadata. Therefore, this extension is built into the
Tank lab conversion pipeline ([tank-lab-to-nwb](https://github.com/catalystneuro/tank-lab-to-nwb))
and is not necessary to be installed separately.
